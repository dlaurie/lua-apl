<h1 id="luaapl-programmers-guide">Lua⋆APL Programmer's Guide</h1>
<p>© Dirk Laurie 2013 Lua-style MIT licence</p>
<p>This part of the documentation is aimed at those who wish understand <code>apl.lua</code>.</p>
<h2 id="registry">Registry</h2>
<p>APL syntax depends on knowing whether a name refers to a function, a monadic operator, a dyadic operator or a value. For the built-in functions, including functions assigned to APL names, this information is predefined, but for user-defined functions, the function or operator must be registered. The name will then shadow an object of the same name in the APL global namespace.</p>
<p>An unregistered name in an APL expression is always assumed to refer to a value.</p>
<p>The registry appears in the source code just before the function <code>register</code> . Each of the five entries is an APL-to-Lua dictionary mapping an APL name to a Lua name. The dictionary <code>Reserved</code> contains items that will be exported in the module table under their Lua names but do not have genuine APL names: the supplied APL name is a mere tag for use by the help facility.</p>
<p>The unclassified dictionary <code>apl_dict</code> keeps track all the Lua names to which an APL name could be mapped and is used only by the help facility.</p>
<h2 id="apl-levels">APL levels</h2>
<p>You can set global <code>_APL_LEVEL</code> before requiring <code>apl</code>. This is mainly intended as a debugging aid. Subsets of APL (each including the previous level) will be loaded as follows:</p>
<dl>
<dt><code>_APL_LEVEL=0</code>:</dt>
<dd>All primitive scalar functions only act on scalars. <code>Range</code> and <code>Reshape</code> are available and create APL arrays, which have Lua indexing with range checks. <code>ToString</code> is fully-featured.
</dd>
<dt><code>_APL_LEVEL=1</code>:</dt>
<dd>All functions act on arrays, mostly treating them as vectors. <code>Disclose</code>, <code>Enclose</code> and <code>Transpose</code> are explicitly matrix-aware. but most of the other functions respect shape only when creating the result.
</dd>
<dt><code>_APL_LEVEL=2</code>: (Default.)</dt>
<dd>Lua⋆APL as documented in the User's Manual. This is the only level that prettyprints by default.
</dd>
<dt><code>_APL_LEVEL&gt;2</code>:</dt>
<dd>Additional fields exposing the working of the system are available in the module table: <code>f1 f2 op1 op2 rank0 rank1 lib APL_ENV</code>. The first four of these contain the functions used by APL, classified as required by the compiler and indexed by their Lua names. The next two contain similarly classified Level 0 and Level 1 versions of functions that have been redefined. <code>lib</code> contains functions that are accessible in library mode but not from APL code. <code>APL_ENV</code> is the global environment for functions compiled by the APL compiler.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The program is divided into five main sections. The first section defines semi-globals, i.e. local variables whose scope is the entire file, plus the APL compiler. Among the semi-globals are twenty-odd short functions that are later exported in <code>apl.util</code>.</p>
<p>The next three sections define levels 0, 1 and 2. Each section is almost a module on its own in the sense that dependencies (except semi-globals) are explicitly assigned to local variables.</p>
<p>The final section populates the module table from the components <code>f1, f2, op1, op2, lib</code> and does some final finishing-off.</p>
<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All functions that will be defined are declared forward as locals. This allows the routines to refer to each other. The programmer is responsible for avoiding circular references.</li>
<li>The functions themselves follow in alphabetic order.</li>
<li>They are collected into a table and assigned to <code>apl.util</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="compiler">Compiler</h2>
<p>The entire compiler consists of a single LPEG grammar, preceded by the definition of its terminals. Considerable thought has gone into the order of alternatives and changes should not be undertaken lightly.</p>
<p>Several functions depend on the compiler, and the opportunity is also taken to define a couple of UTF-8 utilities before the necessary patterns go out of scope.</p>
<p>The redefinition of <code>help</code> is made inside the compiler scope for no very good reason; earlier versions required access to some of the compiler tables.</p>
<h2 id="level-0">Level 0</h2>
<p>This level is fairly straightforward. The code appears in this order:</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Local aliases for functions in global tables are defined. This fixes the function being called to be the one current at the stage that the module is loaded.</li>
<li>Local utility functions, not needed at the other levels and not useful enough to export as utilities, are defined.</li>
<li>The forward-declared functions appear in alphabetic order. Local auxiliary functions needed only by a particular library function are declared immediately before the library function itself.</li>
<li>The functions are collected into tables <code>lib</code> for functions that will not be revealed to the Lua compiler, <code>f1</code> for monadic and <code>f2</code> for dyadic functions that will later be extended to apply to arrays, <code>gen1</code> and <code>gen2</code> for dyadic functions that will not be so extended.</li>
<li>The routines are inserted into the corresponding tables (<code>apl.f1</code> etc.) by the <code>replace</code> utility.</li>
<li>Help is defined (the use of function keys gives a way to check that the corresponding function has been defined).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="level-1">Level 1</h2>
<p>This level has two parts. First, the functions that need to be extended are redefined with the aid of the <code>each</code> and <code>both</code> utilities. For these functions, it is necessary to copy over the help information, since <code>help</code> uses the function itself to index its tables.</p>
<p>Then follows much the same code layout as at Level 1 for the new functions. The main difference is that <code>replace</code> is called with three arguments: if the value associated with a name is being changed, the old value is saved in the table specified by the third argument.</p>
<p>A subtlety here is that some functions appear in more than one list. For example <code>Attach</code> is stored as <code>lib.Attach</code>, <code>f2.Attach1</code> and <code>f2.Attach2</code>. The reason is that the compiler knows two symbols, <code>,</code> and <code>⍪</code>, that at Level 1 are both mapped to <code>Attach</code>, but at Level 2 will be mapped to different functions. The other two names are given to remain compatible with the compiler.</p>
<h2 id="level-2">Level 2</h2>
<p>At this level, almost all the functions being defined are matrix versions of Level 1 functions of the same name. Most of them invoke the Level 1 version in some way.</p>
<p>The functions that will be called but are to be superseded are given local names, mostly simply by converting the name to lower case but occasionally (<code>rawformat</code>,<code>vecget</code> etc) modified to avoid confusion. Level 1 functions that are called but not superseded retain their CamelCase names.</p>
<p>For these functions, the help information is copied over in a separate loop, since <code>replace</code> does not do so.</p>
<p>The functions that at Level 1 appeared in more than one list here form a separate group. They are extended at Level 2 to offer two possibilities, one for row-wise and one for column-wise application. The extended versions have new help information. The Level 1 versions with their help information are still available under the name that contains no axis digit.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-compiler-tables">Building the compiler tables</h2>
<p>At the end of Level 2, the compiler knows almost no APL yet. The whole language is contained in four tables defining the Lua-APL dictionary, which are used together with the information in <code>apl.f1</code> etc to build the registry tables.</p>
<p>The units for functions that allow scanning and reducing over empty vectors are also defined here.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-off">Finishing off</h2>
<p>Miscellaneous small tasks are done here, such as initializing the comparison tolerances, issuing the start-up message, etc.</p>
<h1 id="comparison-with-apl2">Comparison with APL2</h1>
<p>Though not an official standard, IBM's APL2 was a landmark and is well documented (google for <code>APL2LanguageRef.pdf</code>). Lua⋆APL is not and will not be an implementation of the same APL dialect as APL2, but in cases where Lua⋆APL extends older APL usage in the same way as APL2 does, I have tried to use the same symbol for the extension.</p>
<p>Differences of which I am aware between features provided by APL2 and Lua⋆APL are listed below. Unless marked &quot;TODO&quot;, there are no plans to resolve those differences. Even the &quot;TODO&quot;'s are not all features that I am sure about.</p>
<p>I would like, though, to be told of any differences not listed or implied below.</p>
<h3 id="downward-incompatibilities">Downward incompatibilities</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Complex numbers are not supported. Implications include that monadic <code>+</code> means <code>Copy</code>, not <code>Conjugate</code>, monadic <code>×</code> means <code>Sign</code>, not <code>Direction</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Arrays of rank higher than 2 are not supported. Implications include that is no dyadic <code>⍉</code>, etc, and that separate functions and operators are provided for working along the first axis.</li>
<li>Nested arrays are provided via Lua tables, respecting Lua's natural row-wise order. Implications include that monadic <code>⊂</code> or <code>⊃</code> respectively enclose or disclose rows (and if ever extended, will do one rank at a time), and there is no dyadic <code>⊂</code> or <code>⊃</code>, etc.</li>
<li>System variables have different names and do different things.</li>
<li>Index origin 1, not selectable.</li>
<li><code>≠</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> do not depend on comparison tolerance.</li>
<li>ASCII names for functions are often different even when the function is essentially the same, as motivated above under [Library Mode].</li>
<li>Monadic <code>≡</code> is Lua length; dyadic <code>≡</code> is Lua identity.</li>
<li>No <code>⍷</code>, monadic <code>∊</code> or <code>⌷</code>.</li>
<li>TODO: Dyadic <code>~</code>.</li>
<li>TODO: Monadic <code>↑</code>.</li>
<li>TODO: Dyadic <code>⍒</code> and <code>⍋</code> (will work differently, though).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="upward-incompatibilities">Upward incompatibilities</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Lua⋆APL is a Lua package. All of Lua is available. The implications are not individually listed; they include that scalars can be any Lua value except a table, Lua functions can be used to index an array, arrays can be modified at the Lua level, some string-valued keys are used, etc.</li>
<li>Lua⋆APL can be extended by Lua functions registered under APL names. This could be used to provided some non-implemented functionality.</li>
<li>Namespaces.</li>
<li><code>∇</code> is a function acting on a string or function and returning a function.</li>
<li>Lua⋆APL supports strings, not character arrays.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h1 id="the-core-c-routines">The core C routines</h1>
<p>Some of these have been adapted from other packages: for the block functions and the style of documentation below I acknowledge useful ideas of John Hind. They are delivered in a table returned by <code>require apl_core</code>.</p>
<p>The table also returns six functions needed for the <code>Circ</code> function (APL <code>○</code>) which are not described here.</p>
<h2 id="block-functions">Block functions</h2>
<p>Block functions all have a table and two integers as their first three arguments. The notation <code>tbl[a:b]</code> is used for a block of values with increasing keys if <code>a&lt;b</code> and decreasing keys if <code>a&gt;b</code>. Thus <code>tbl[b:a]</code> is the reverse of <code>tbl[a:b]</code>.</p>
<h3 id="gettblab"><code>get(tbl,a,b)</code></h3>
<p>Returns <code>tbl[a:b]</code>. This function may cause stack overflow if too many items are requested.</p>
<h3 id="movetblabcd"><code>move(tbl,a,b,c[,d])</code></h3>
<p>Moves <code>tbl[a,b]</code> to <code>tbl[c,d]</code>, overwriting whatever was there. If omitted, <code>d</code> is calculated so that <code>b-a == d-c</code>. Returns <code>tbl</code>.</p>
<h3 id="picktblabfctcount"><code>pick(tbl,a,b,fct[,count])</code></h3>
<p>If <code>count==1</code>, returns the first index <code>i</code> in <code>a:b</code> such that <code>fct(tbl[i])</code> is true. If <code>count&gt;1</code>, ignores the first <code>count-1</code> hits. If <code>fct</code> is not a function or if <code>count&lt;1,</code> returns nil.</p>
<h3 id="settblab..."><code>set(tbl,a,b,...)</code></h3>
<p>Sets <code>tbl[a:b]</code> to the given values, overwriting existing values. Returns <code>tbl</code>.</p>
<p>If the vararg list is empty (not even containing <code>nil</code>), stores nothing. The list is treated cyclically: if it is exhausted before <code>b</code> is reached, the supply of values is resumed from its beginning. If <code>b</code> is nil, values are stored in <code>tbl[a],tbl[a+1],...</code> until the list is exhausted.</p>
<h3 id="transposetblabtarget"><code>transpose(tbl,a,b,target)</code></h3>
<p>Stores the transpose of <code>tbl[1:a*b]</code> in <code>target[1:a*b]</code>. <code>tbl</code> is assumed to contain <code>a</code> blocks of <code>b</code> elements, and <code>target</code> will contain <code>b</code> blocks of <code>a</code> elements. Returns <code>target</code>.</p>
<p><code>tbl</code> and <code>target</code> are not allowed to be the same array.</p>
<h2 id="apl-functions">APL functions</h2>
<p>These functions operate on or return tables that conform to the specifications for APL arrays. See main documentation.</p>
<h3 id="bothfx1x2e1e2"><code>both(f,x1,x2,e1,e2)</code></h3>
<pre><code>Applies binary `f` term-by-term to every pair of corresponding 
elements of `x1` and `x2`, whose sizes must be compatible as
specified by `e1` and `e2`.

`e1=0; e2=0`
:   `x1` and `x2` must have the same shape, which is also the
     shape of the result.
`e1=1`
:   `x1` may be a singleton, treated as equivalent to a constant
    array of the same shape as `x2`.
`e2=1`
:   `x2` may be a singleton, treared as equivalent to a constant
    array of the same shape as `x1`.
`e1=2`
:   `x1` is treated as a constant first argument even if it is
    an array.
`e2=2`
:   `x2` is treated as a constant second argument even if it is
    an array. </code></pre>
<h3 id="compatab"><code>compat(a,b)</code></h3>
<p>Tests whether <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are compatible for term-by-term dyadic functions. That means one of the following conditions holds:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><code>a</code> or <code>b</code> is a scalar or a one-element array.</li>
<li><code>a</code> and <code>b</code> have the same shape.</li>
<li><code>a</code> or <code>b</code> is a vector, and the other is a one-row or a one-column matrix of the same length.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="eachfx"><code>each(f,x)</code></h3>
<p>Applies unary <code>f</code> term-by-term to every element of <code>x</code>, producing a result of the same shape as <code>x</code>.</p>
<h3 id="iotanstart1"><code>iota(n[,start=1])</code></h3>
<p>Returns an APL vector containing the first <code>n</code> integers from the given start.</p>
<h3 id="rhovmn"><code>rho(v,m[,n])</code></h3>
<p>Returns an APL vector of length <code>m</code>, or an APL matrix of shape <code>m×n</code>, filled with copies of <code>v</code>.</p>
<h3 id="svda"><code>svd(A)</code></h3>
<p>Calls the LAPACK routine <code>dgesvd</code> and organizes its output into a Lua table containing APL arrays <code>U</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>V</code>. See User's Manual.</p>
<h2 id="other-functions">Other functions</h2>
<h3 id="is_intx"><code>is_int(x)</code></h3>
<p>Tests whether <code>x</code> equals <code>tointeger(x)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="keepcount..."><code>keep(count,...)</code></h3>
<p>Returns <code>count</code> arguments, starting at the first extra argument. As in the case of <code>select</code>, a negative number indexes from the end (-1 is the last argument).</p>
<h3 id="mapft..."><code>map(ft,...)</code></h3>
<p>Each return value is the result of <code>ft</code> applied to the corresponding value in the tuple.</p>
<p>&quot;Applying&quot; means indexing if <code>ft</code> is a table and calling if <code>ft</code> is a function, which is assumed to be unary with one return value.</p>
<h3 id="tointegerx"><code>tointeger(x)</code></h3>
<p>The result of the API function <code>lua_tointeger</code>.</p>
<h3 id="wherelevel"><code>where(level)</code></h3>
<p>Returns a string identifying the point in the source code from which <code>where</code> is being called if <code>level=1</code>, the point from which that routine was called if <code>level=2</code>, etc.</p>
